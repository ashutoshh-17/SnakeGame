- Adjustable game speed
- Simple and clean user interface

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashutoshh-17/SnakeGame.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    cd snake-game-tutorial
    ```

3. **Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse):**

    - Import the project as a Maven project if you're using a build tool.
    - Alternatively, you can create a new Java project and add the source files manually.

## Usage

To run the Snake game:

#### Running the Executable JAR File

1. Ensure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
2. Run the JAR file.
   ```sh
   java -jar Snake.jar
   ```   

2. **Run the game:**
